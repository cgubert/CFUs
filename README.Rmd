CFUs.R is a program that can assist users in calculating colony forming units and appropriate dilution factors for bacterial cultures. The function "dilution.factor" can calculate what dilution factor results from two given volumes from final volume, aliquot volume, and dilutent volume. Alternatly, the "volumes" function can give appropriate volumes needed to attain a specific dilution factor.
