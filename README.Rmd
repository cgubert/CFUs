CFUs.R is a program that can assist users in calculating colony forming units and appropriate dilution factors for bacterial cultures. The function "dilution.factor" can calculate what dilution factor results from two given volumes from final volume, aliquot volume, and dilutent volume. Alternatly, the "volumes" function can give appropriate volumes needed to attain a specific dilution factor. The capstone function of this program is "CFU" which will give the number of colony forming units in the original bacterial culture from a colony count and dilution factor. "CFU" uses data from a data.frame where the columns are colony counts from multiple replicates and the rows are different dilutions, expressed as a ratio
