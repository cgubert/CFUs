#Want a program that will calculate CFUs in original (stock) bacterial culture
#when given number of colonies on plate and dilution factor
#so, function should run off of something like "CFU(colonies=250,DF=10:1)"
#also include funtion that will give appropriate dilution factor to use to 
#count colonies from a solution with a given CFU concentration
#so this function would look something like "DF(CFU=15.0*10^8)
#Dilution factor (DF): ratio of final volume/aliquot volume 
#(final volume = aliquot + diluent)

#Should be able to calculate CFUs from a data set/list of colony count values
#Input data from colony counts I did last week to use 

CFU<-function(colonies,DF){
  
}
